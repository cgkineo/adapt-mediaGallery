# adapt-mediaGallery

This component extends the functionality of `adapt-contrib-media` by providing a gallery of videos from which the user can select. Each video can be configured with its own poster image and multi-language closed captioning.

This component supports the same device and browser specification as `adapt-contrib-media` and is accessible. Accordingly it follows a similar configuration (see `example.json`). See the `README` of `adapt-contrib-media` for further details.

## Settings Overview

The attributes listed below are used in *components.json* to configure **MediaGallery**, and are properly formatted as JSON in [*example.json*](https://github.com/cgkineo/adapt-mediaGallery/blob/master/example.json).

## Attributes

### \_component (string):
This must be set to: `"mediagallery"`.
